# Collection of useful userscripts

To install any of my scripts, just install a userscript manager such as [violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
Then just choose on any script of your choice by viewing the file in GitHub and clicking on the `Raw` button.

Then the script will be installed in your browser automatically.
Next you will just have to activate it in your userscript-manager-settings.
